        <h3>Flexbox Basic Layout Samples</h3>


        <p>These are basic layout samples that I did using flexbox. Not only it
          makes the page look good, its a good way to improve the sites
          responsive design in order for it to work successfully on users
          device.</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>

        <hr style="width:50%">


        <p>What I found easy? Once you get the overall basics down with
          Flexbox, its pretty easy to figure out. The properties may seem
          intimidating at times but they are simple once you figure out how to
          make them all actually work. The only trouble I had was remembering to
          size the flex area. The boxes that separate the flexing elements. It
          was fun once I figure everything out. Just took too much time.</p>

        <h3>Conversions</h3>

        <a class="button" href="http://practice.robinsonsdesigns.com/lp3part3/grid.html">Grid
          Layout</a> <a class="button" href="http://practice.robinsonsdesigns.com/lp3part3/flex.html">Flexbox
          Layout</a>

        <p>Our objective was to convert a basic CSS design to a grid and
          flexbox layout. The results are above. The layouts that are on the
          bottom are the normal links that don't have either flexbox or grid
          associated with them.</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>

        <hr style="width:50%">


        <p>Concerting flex to grid and grid to flex was harder than I realized
          it. Why? Because you aren't just trying to keep everything tiding and
          correct, you are also working with the responsiveness of the layout in
          order to make it look like it never changed. A website may look like it
          has grid but it may just have flexible boxes instead. Sometimes you may
          even find yourself having to combine grid and flexbox together in order
          to make everything work out. There's no shame for doing that!</p>

          Grid Layout Project 5</a>

        <p>In this part, we had to work with the CSS Layout property: Grid. Our
          objective is to learn exactly how to use the grid layout to become
          responsive.</p>


        <h3>Reflection</h3>

        <hr style="width:50%">


        <p>Okay, despite it being in the debugging folder of the site, it was
          sort of both learning and debugging along the way. Regardless of what
          name they are under, I still learned all about grids and how they
          differ between flexbox. For example, grid layouts are used to make
          webpages without having to use floats or other positioning elements.
          Flexbox is a one dimensional layout and is able to be used with all
          kinds of devices and screen sizes.</p>


        <h3>Final Reflection</h3>

        <hr style="width:50%">


        <p>Flexbox and Grid CSS layouts were challenging and fun at the same
          time. They really sound easy to do when you get a chance to work with
          them and only them. Focusing on those two layout properties and no
          other properties was the easiest. You learn easier that way and that
          what made me more comfortable with these two. Its not about the
          projects that got me the most, its the results that inspire me to grow
          in what challenges me the most and what I need to improve on.</p>
