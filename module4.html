        <h3>Responsive Website Design</h3>


        <p>Responsive design has three general catagories that needs to be addressed: Mobile Phone, Tablet, and
          Computer. These three are critical for responsive design.</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>

        <hr style="width:50%">

        <p>The big three are mobile phone, tablet, and computer for responsive design. They are critical to learn and a
          must for any websites today. You wouldn't want a website to be unworkable on desktop when its 100% functional
          on a mobile device? That makes me think of Snapchat trying to become a computer and tablet webapp when it
          fails to have a responsive design even on tablet.</p>

        <h3>Final Reflection</h3>

        <hr style="width:50%">

        <p style="text-indent: 5%;">Mobile Devices, Tablets, and Computers are becoming a must have for todays tech world. In order to make sure
          that people are getting the best user experience, it is critical to understand the importance of responsive
          website design. I had a wonderful time implementing ways on how to make a design work on the smallest screen,
          a smartwatch. I have friends with smartwatches and would like to give them a few more options on where to
          check out my website at.</p>
          <p>They won't be left out anytime soon, since smartwatches are becoming more
          user-friendly and can support more software than ever before. I personally don't have one, but responsive
          design making efforts to include the smartwatch is what gets developers excited for the upcoming years. This
          module was challenging starting out but learning how responsive design is almost as important as
          accessibility, the hard work is never done, I learned that.</p>
