    <p>For this first module, we relearned about the basics of CSS properties
      including color and fonts. We had to replace divs with the CSS elements
      like 'header' and 'footer'.Below I will explain what these <i>two parts</i>
      were about and what I learned from these exorcises.</p>

        <p>In part one we needed to understand the basic CSS and HTML5
          elements. I thought the practice parts were really fun yet challenging.
          It was challenging in a way that makes you think as if you were in the
          field and is tasked to fix a HTML document. I made sure to change the
          tags that were needed to be changed. Linking the CSS document before
          you even made said document was a good plan since it reminded me to
          copy and paste the code between the 'style' tags and import them to the
          CSS document.</p>
      </section>


      <section class="grid-item item2">
        <h3>Part 2</h3>

        <hr style="width:50%">
        <a class="button" href="http://practice.robinsonsdesigns.com/lp1part2/part2_practice.html">Part
          2 Practice</a>

        <p>This part we made our own sample using some of the template we
          already worked on in part 1. The sample is basically showing what you
          know about CSS. We needed to identify HTML and CSS systematic that we
          used on the document.<br>
          It was a draft that we will work on more in the coming weeks. What I
          could change about part 2 is that; explaining the elements for both CSS
          and HTML. I also need to put in what I learned from them and how I
          managed to learn it for next time. Repeating what you learned will
          probably do me some good.</p>


        <h3>Reflection</h3>

        <hr style="width:50%">


        <p>Part two was done and completed using the practice 2 files. I made
          changes that I thought were best and had fun reviewing the different
          properties and elements of CSS and HTML5.</p>


        <h3>Final Reflection</h3>

        <hr style="width:50%">


        <p>In short, module one was a good start at basic review for CSS and
          HTML elements. It has helped me understand the importance of CSS. Until
          I hear something differently, CSS is like decorating a house. HTML is a
          house that hasn't been decorated yet.</p>
