    <p>In module 2, we had to work with different properties in CSS. Making
    sure we are understanding the key aspects of the CSS properties is critical
    for a good design for a web page. That way we are able to debug easily and
    efficiently.</p>

        <p>Doing these exercises, I learned the importance of each CSS
        properties. Knowing that each are just as important as the other is
        critical for learning website design.</p>

        <h3>CSS Design Project</h3>

        <a class="button" href=
        "https://practice.robinsonsdesigns.com/projects/background.html">Design
        Project</a>

        <p>This project had us showing off our skills and employing them to our
        web page. We didn't need to worry about the design of the web page
        itself, just needed to show the property values in all their glory.</p>


        <h3>Reflection</h3>

        <hr style="width:50%">


        <p>This was a little challenging for me considering I am not one to
        just paste a property to show it off without being a little organized
        at first. But it makes me happy knowing that I may be educating others
        about CSS properties when they jump onto my page.</p>


        <h3>Final Reflection</h3>

        <hr style="width:50%">


        <p>With these two projects and module under my belt, I learned the
        importance of CSS Properties and their sole purpose for design and
        organization. The outcome of these exercises and actually implementing
        them onto my website will be a great resource in the future. One can
        even use my website as a resource with the examples covering the CSS
        properties that I have listed. A great asset for the rookie web
        dev.</p>
